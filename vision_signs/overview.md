# Project Overview

## Background

Aaron once shared a vision of having an interactive display at the pump house describing some of the features of the campground.  This project is in that spirit.  The difference is that this project will use printed signs to tell the story.  In the future, the content may be repurposed:

- as an on-site interactive display (as originally proposed by Aaron)
- as a mobile app
- as parrts of a web site

but for now, the intent of this project is to get a "paper prototype" so that we can refine the stories and get it into the world to see how it lands.

The site is a rich collection of overlapping uses

- primateive camp ground
  - weekend recreation
  - seasonal residence for sunbirds (AKA snowbirds)
  - seasonal home for workers in local businesses
  - events
- working farm
- working orchard
- businesses
  - Rock Solid Trail Building
  - Various co-working m

## Goals

- Encourage folks at [CG, The Genny] to buy produce
- Inspire folks at [CG, The Genny] with "The Vision" (of CG and farm)
- Encourage folks to visit farm
- Direct folks on guided farm tour.  Educate, inspire, engage.

- Promote farm produce to campers.  Campsiates are adjacent to farm fields, but campers don't know how to purchase food.  Let them know where to buy the produce.  Enroll them in the story of "eating so local" that they actually sleep next to where their food is grown.
- Promote the farm to "roadside stand" in cooler outside of "The Genny".  The current set-up looks like an adjunct POS vending machine.  It could do a lot better at promoting the farm, inviting folks to take a tour, enrolling them in "eat local", and getting them to buy into a much bigger story than just "buying another carrot or tomatoe".  Sell the vision, not just the goods.
- Describe "the artifacts" of the vision: fields, trails, building, trees, walls.
- Describe the story behind "the artifacts"
- Desribe the vision behind the story.

## Artifacts

## Values

## Vision

I have heard Aaron say
> People need 4 (or 5) things to be [need word here].  Clean water.  Healthy food.  Safe living.  [Others?].  If they have these, they can thrive, grow, and work together.  If they don't, they can't.

His vision for this property (and maybe a mission for his life) is to provide that.

It's easy to see the camp sites.  It's not so obvious that there is beauty, safety, and the experience of nature (trees, chipmunks, quiet (to fall asleep to frogs, sleep with rustling of the wind, and wake up to birds), dark (to get away from the lights of the city).  It's even less obvious that those elements are part of the plan for getting clean, safe, wholesome living to give people the 3 (or 5) itesms that are so easily on top of his mind.

I've heard this vision 2-3 times from him and applied it to the campground.  I am sure that he applies the same values to the trails he builds, and to Rock Solid (as a compnay).  He considers the company employees in this vision as much as he does the riders of the trail.

## Deliverables

This project should produce the following "signs" to help visitors learn the story of this lands

- Big Vision - A large plaque or multi-sign display.  At the pump house.  Main overview that ties a lot of this together.  Lists artifacts.  Explains vision.  Lists values.  Gives directions to other signs around the property.
- Field signs - At each field, a sign names the field and explains the goal of that growing area.  Gives enrolling story about "eat local" and encouragement to buy produce at The Genny.
- Orcahrd signs - Similar to field signs

For each planting area in ../source/cultivated_areas.md, create a file in vision_signs/ directory.
