# Trails End & Soil & Soul Interpretive Signage Style Guide

## 1. Purpose

Establish consistent, durable, and engaging interpretive and educational signage across Trails End Campground and Soil & Soul Farm. Signs should inspire curiosity, respect for the land, and a sense of shared stewardship.

## 2. Audience & Reading Goals

| Visitor Type | Context | Reading Duration | Word Range |
|---------------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| Passing hiker / biker | Glance while moving | 3–5 sec | 15–25 words |
| Curious visitor | Stops briefly | 20–30 sec | 40–80 words |
| Engaged learner | Reads full panel | 1–3 min | 100–150 words |

Use the **3-30-3 Rule**: communicate something meaningful in 3 seconds, reward curiosity for 30 seconds, and reward engagement for 3 minutes.

## 3. Design Principles

- **One Story per Panel:** Focus each sign on a single idea or theme.
- **Thematic Hook:** Lead with a question or statement that answers “Why should I care?”
- **Balanced Visuals:** Pair text with relevant photos, illustrations, or diagrams (ideally 40% text / 60% image).
- **Accessible Design:** High contrast (min. 70%), clear sans-serif fonts, matte finish, and Braille or QR code where possible.
- **Durability:** Weatherproof materials (powder-coated metal, recycled HDPE, or engraved cedar). Replace or refresh panels every 7–10 years.
- **Sustainability:** Use low-VOC inks and recyclable substrates.

## 4. Typography & Layout

| Element | Font | Size | Notes |
|----------|------|------|-------|
| Title | Source Sans Pro Bold | 2.0–2.5 in | ≤ 8 words; sentence case |
| Subtitle | Source Sans Pro SemiBold | 1.25 in | optional; ≤ 12 words |
| Body | Source Sans Pro Regular | 0.75–1.0 in | 40–120 words; ≤ 50 characters per line |
| Caption | Source Sans Pro Italic | 0.65 in | short image credit or label |

- Minimum contrast ratio 70%.  
- Maintain 15–25% whitespace.
- Align left for readability.

## 5. Color & Material Palette

| Text | Charcoal / black | — | Matte |
| Accent / header bar | Forest green or deep rust | — | Low gloss |
| Illustrations / maps | Natural tones; avoid high saturation | — | Matte print |

## 6. Placement & Orientation

- Mount height: 42–48 in (eye level for adults and wheelchair users).
- Angle: 30–45° for wayside panels; vertical for upright exhibits.
- Distance: 2–6 ft viewing range for reading; avoid glare from sun angle.
- Orientation: Align so viewers face the landscape or object being interpreted.

## 7. Content Framework

| Section | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Title | Emotional or thematic hook | e.g., "The Soil That Breathes" |
| Intro (1–2 sentences) | Contextual overview | Establish relevance quickly |
| Body | Key story / explanation | Include dates, names, and sensory description |

## 8. Accessibility & Inclusivity

- Provide QR codes linking to audio narration and translations.
- Ensure fonts are ≥ 18 pt equivalent at standard viewing distance.
- Use symbols and plain language for key concepts.
- Avoid jargon; favor storytelling and active voice.

## 9. Review & Testing

- **Prototype:** Create a full-scale mock-up for readability and glare testing.
- **Field Review:** Check sight lines, visitor approach, and safety.
- **Feedback:** Pilot with at least 3 diverse readers; ask if message was clear and engaging.
