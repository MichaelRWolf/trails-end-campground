Many of the growing areas have names (e.g. "Hope").

## Hope - A vegetable

## Site20 - A future vegetable bed

## Blueberry Field

## Blackberry Trellaces

Thornless berries.  Huge.  Broght here by Aaron's mom, Linda.

## Lavendar Bed

Planted in Summer 2025.  Previously a strawberry bed.  Did not work well.  Experiment.  Live and learn.

## Peach Trees

2023 - Planted
2024 - Fenced inaccessable
2025 - First harvest

During September 2025, the fruit was so heavy that back-to-back gales broke some of the branches.

10 trees.

## Open Field Orchard

The namesake of "Orchard Trail", a loop that circles the lake ("Fake Lake").

Many varieties of apple tree.  A few pear trees.  A few cherry trees.

Not in traditional rows.  Makes it more "natural", and pleasing to the eye as you walk around the trail.  Layering -- food production, park, aesthetics, avoid mono-culture, mixes fruit trees with wild flowers

## Wildflower fields

When possible, fields are left unmowed to allow wild flowers to grow.  Beautiful for humans.  Pollen sources for pollenators.  Biodiversity.  Less maintenance and mosiwng and fossil fuels.  Occasionally mowed for large events.  Gives campers a more natural experience thatn a city-manicured plot.

## Flower Bed 1

## Flower Bed 2

## Flower Beds on The Point

These cascaded beds provide a wonderful sight for hikers on the orcahard trail.  The terraces also provide space for events (e.g. adventure rallys, bike races, weddings) with views of the lake.

## Walls and Flower Beds

Many of the walls on The Point, around the lake, and the flower beds


The walls were created as part of a training exericise.  Years ago, Aaron needed a way to train workers at Rock Solid how to build walls.  They didn't know how.  They needed to know for a project elsewhere.  By building them here, they learned skills for use on other contracts.
