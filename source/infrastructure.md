## The Point

Mostly the same shape left after the ice age 11,000 - 15,000 years ago.  Shaped to allow views.  And flat spots for events.  Dramatic view from here across lake or up to Brockway Mountain.

Dramatic view to The Point and the walls and flower beds from many spots around the lake or on the Orchard Trail

## Walls and Flower Beds

Many of the walls on The Point, around the lake, and the flower beds were created as part of a training exericise.  Years ago, Aaron needed a way to train workers at Rock Solid how to build walls.  They didn't know how.  They needed to know for a project elsewhere.  By building them here, they learned skills for use on other contracts.


## The Orchard Trail

The terminus of a trail that goes to Copper Harbor after passing turn-off to Hunters Point and to the Copper Harbor Marina.

The trail originally lead to the point.  In 2023, it was completed to circle the whole campground and lake.  Great for families with small kids.  Or walks around the lake.

During Trail Fest on Labor Day, it is the site of the Junior Race where kids up to 9 years old compete for prizes, but mostly compete for being the most adorable.  As young as 2 years old, they are all adorable.  Cute.  It's great to see families introducing their kids to bkiking.

## Solar Generator

20-ish panels.  Total of XXX Watts. Capable of generating NN,000 kilowatt-hours on a good day.


## Pump House

Takes water from the lake, distributes to fields.  Uses solar power.  Can run from battries for a limited time.  Backup generator allows pump to run when too many cloudy days.

## Tunnels

Called tunnels (or high tunnels) because they do NOT have temperature (heat) or climate control (fans).  Common croops - tomatoes, tomatillos, basil, eggplant, cucumbers.

## Greenhouse

Temperature controlled (propane furnace to heat, or roof vents and fans to cool).  Starter plants in the spring.  Drying herbs in the summer.

## Pit Toilets

Not just functional.  They are beautiful works of art.  Each one has self-contained solar panel, battery, solar collector, and lights.  Note how dim the lights are.  They do not obstruct the night sky, but provide just enough guidance to navigate at night.  They assume that the user has a flashlight instaed of blasting the night with overpowered light that is typically not needed, and would be obtrusive all the time.
