## Aaron's Definitions

Aaron once shared some insights into how humans have evolved our thinking about and relationship to nature.  Here's what he remembers.

### Ecology 1.0

Humans begin to study nature, especially how humans relate to and change nature.

### Ecology 2.0

In an effort to prevent human damage to nature, we separate from it.  Create no-build zones.  Development zones.  Urban refuges where huimans are not a allowed.  

By balancing nature versus humans, there is an implicit separation of the two, and an implied zero-sum game where gains for one are losses for another.

Because humans spoil nature, it is best to put all the humans in as small a footprint a possible, leaving huge swaths of nature to exist without human interaction.  This did decreatse the human impact on large chunks of nature, but it also had people disconnect from nature.  They did not visit it, so they did not respect it or value it.  It was inaccessable on a daily basis.  "Nature" became a concept instead of a lived reality.

This separation spawned "Nature Defecit Disorder", a playful term that indicates how much our milleniaums of evolution made us depend on nature for our needs - physical, physiological, spiritual, emotional, mental health.

### Ecology 3.0

Building on previous steps, we integrate with and co-exist with nature instgead of separating from it.  By living in harmony with nature, we do not need to separate from it.  There is not the separation from Ecology 2.0.  It is not a zero-sum game.  There can be benefits to both nature and humans by occupying the same space.  This is true at many levels, including a spiritual or psychological.
